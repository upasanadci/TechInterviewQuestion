1. ### What are the possible ways to create objects in JavaScript

   There are many ways to create objects in javascript as below

   1. **Object constructor:**

      The simplest way to create an empty object is using the Object constructor. Currently this approach is not recommended.

      ```javascript
      var object = new Object();
      ```

   2. **Object's create method:**

      The create method of Object creates a new object by passing the prototype object as a parameter

      ```javascript
      var object = Object.create(null);
      ```

   3. **Object literal syntax:**

      The object literal syntax (or object initializer), is a comma-separated set of name-value pairs wrapped in curly braces.

      ```javascript
      var object = {
           name: "Sudheer",
           age: 34
      };

      Object literal property values can be of any data type, including array, function, and nested object.
      ```

      **Note:** This is an easiest way to create an object

   4. **Function constructor:**

      Create any function and apply the new operator to create object instances,

      ```javascript
      function Person(name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = 21;
      }
      var object = new Person("Upasana");
      ```

  

      ```javascript
      function func() {};

      new func(x, y, z);
      ```

      **(OR)**

      ```javascript
      // Create a new instance using function prototype.
      var newInstance = Object.create(func.prototype)

      // Call the function
      var result = func.call(newInstance, x, y, z),

      // If the result is a non-null object then use it otherwise just use the new instance.
      console.log(result && typeof result === 'object' ? result : newInstance);
      ```

   6. **ES6 Class syntax:**

      ES6 introduces class feature to create the objects

      ```javascript
      class Person {
        constructor(name) {
          this.name = name;
        }
      }

      var object = new Person("Upasana");
      ```

   7. **Singleton pattern:**

      A Singleton is an object which can only be instantiated one time. Repeated calls to its constructor return the same instance and this way one can ensure that they don't accidentally create multiple instances.

      ```javascript
      var object = new (function () {
        this.name = "Sudheer";
      })();
      ```

3. ### What is the difference between Call, Apply and Bind

   The difference between Call, Apply and Bind can be explained with below examples,

   **Call:** The call() method invokes a function with a given `this` value and arguments provided one by one

   ```javascript
   var employee1 = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Rodson" };
   var employee2 = { firstName: "Jimmy", lastName: "Baily" };

   function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
     console.log(
       greeting1 + " " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + ", " + greeting2
     );
   }

   invite.call(employee1, "Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
   invite.call(employee2, "Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
   ```

   **Apply:** Invokes the function with a given `this` value and allows you to pass in arguments as an array

   ```javascript
   var employee1 = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Rodson" };
   var employee2 = { firstName: "Jimmy", lastName: "Baily" };

   function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
     console.log(
       greeting1 + " " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + ", " + greeting2
     );
   }

   invite.apply(employee1, ["Hello", "How are you?"]); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
   invite.apply(employee2, ["Hello", "How are you?"]); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
   ```

   **bind:** returns a new function, allowing you to pass any number of arguments

   ```javascript
   var employee1 = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Rodson" };
   var employee2 = { firstName: "Jimmy", lastName: "Baily" };

   function invite(greeting1, greeting2) {
     console.log(
       greeting1 + " " + this.firstName + " " + this.lastName + ", " + greeting2
     );
   }

   var inviteEmployee1 = invite.bind(employee1);
   var inviteEmployee2 = invite.bind(employee2);
   inviteEmployee1("Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello John Rodson, How are you?
   inviteEmployee2("Hello", "How are you?"); // Hello Jimmy Baily, How are you?
   ```

   Call and apply are pretty interchangeable. Both execute the current function immediately. You need to decide whether it’s easier to send in an array or a comma separated list of arguments. You can remember by treating Call is for **comma** (separated list) and Apply is for **Array**.

   Whereas Bind creates a new function that will have `this` set to the first parameter passed to bind().

4. ### What is JSON and its common operations

   **JSON** is a text-based data format following JavaScript object syntax, which was popularized by `Douglas Crockford`. It is useful when you want to transmit data across a network and it is basically just a text file with an extension of .json, and a MIME type of application/json

   **Parsing:** Converting a string to a native object

   ```javascript
   JSON.parse(text);
   ```

   **Stringification:** converting a native object to a string so it can be transmitted across the network

   ```javascript
   JSON.stringify(object);
   ```

5. ### What is the purpose of the array slice method

   The **slice()** method returns the selected elements in an array as a new array object. It selects the elements starting at the given start argument, and ends at the given optional end argument without including the last element. If you omit the second argument then it selects till the end.

   Some of the examples of this method are,

   ```javascript
   let arrayIntegers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   let arrayIntegers1 = arrayIntegers.slice(0, 2); // returns [1,2]
   let arrayIntegers2 = arrayIntegers.slice(2, 3); // returns [3]
   let arrayIntegers3 = arrayIntegers.slice(4); //returns [5]
   ```

   **Note:** Slice method won't mutate the original array but it returns the subset as a new array.

   **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

6. ### What is the purpose of the array splice method

   The **splice()** method is used either adds/removes items to/from an array, and then returns the removed item. The first argument specifies the array position for insertion or deletion whereas the optional second argument indicates the number of elements to be deleted. Each additional argument is added to the array.

   Some of the examples of this method are,

   ```javascript
   let arrayIntegersOriginal1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   let arrayIntegersOriginal2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   let arrayIntegersOriginal3 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

   let arrayIntegers1 = arrayIntegersOriginal1.splice(0, 2); // returns [1, 2]; original array: [3, 4, 5]
   let arrayIntegers2 = arrayIntegersOriginal2.splice(3); // returns [4, 5]; original array: [1, 2, 3]
   let arrayIntegers3 = arrayIntegersOriginal3.splice(3, 1, "a", "b", "c"); //returns [4]; original array: [1, 2, 3, "a", "b", "c", 5]
   ```

   **Note:** Splice method modifies the original array and returns the deleted array.

7. ### What is the difference between slice and splice

   Some of the major difference in a tabular form

   | Slice                                        | Splice                                          |
   | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
   | Doesn't modify the original array(immutable) | Modifies the original array(mutable)            |
   | Returns the subset of original array         | Returns the deleted elements as array           |
   | Used to pick the elements from array         | Used to insert or delete elements to/from array |

8. ### How do you compare Object and Map

   **Objects** are similar to **Maps** in that both let you set keys to values, retrieve those values, delete keys, and detect whether something is stored at a key. Due to this reason, Objects have been used as Maps historically. But there are important differences that make using a Map preferable in certain cases.

   1. The keys of an Object are Strings and Symbols, whereas they can be any value for a Map, including functions, objects, and any primitive.
   2. The keys in Map are ordered while keys added to Object are not. Thus, when iterating over it, a Map object returns keys in order of insertion.
   3. You can get the size of a Map easily with the size property, while the number of properties in an Object must be determined manually.
   4. A Map is an iterable and can thus be directly iterated, whereas iterating over an Object requires obtaining its keys in some fashion and iterating over them.
   5. An Object has a prototype, so there are default keys in the map that could collide with your keys if you're not careful. As of ES5 this can be bypassed by using map = Object.create(null), but this is seldom done.
   6. A Map may perform better in scenarios involving frequent addition and removal of key pairs.

9. ### What is the difference between == and === operators

   JavaScript provides both strict(===, !==) and type-converting(==, !=) equality comparison. The strict operators take type of variable in consideration, while non-strict operators make type correction/conversion based upon values of variables. The strict operators follow the below conditions for different types,

   1. Two strings are strictly equal when they have the same sequence of characters, same length, and same characters in corresponding positions.
   2. Two numbers are strictly equal when they are numerically equal. i.e, Having the same number value.
      There are two special cases in this,
      1. NaN is not equal to anything, including NaN.
      2. Positive and negative zeros are equal to one another.
   3. Two Boolean operands are strictly equal if both are true or both are false.
   4. Two objects are strictly equal if they refer to the same Object.
   5. Null and Undefined types are not equal with ===, but equal with ==. i.e,
      null===undefined --> false but null==undefined --> true

   Some of the example which covers the above cases,

   ```javascript
   0 == false   // true
   0 === false  // false
   1 == "1"     // true
   1 === "1"    // false
   null == undefined // true
   null === undefined // false
   '0' == false // true
   '0' === false // false
   []==[] or []===[] //false, refer different objects in memory
   {}=={} or {}==={} //false, refer different objects in memory
   ```

10. ### What are lambda or arrow functions

    An arrow function is a shorter syntax for a function expression and does not have its own **this, arguments, super, or new.target**. These functions are best suited for non-method functions, and they cannot be used as constructors.

11. ### What is a first class function

    In Javascript, functions are first class objects. First-class functions means when functions in that language are treated like any other variable.

    For example, in such a language, a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, can be returned by another function and can be assigned as a value to a variable. For example, in the below example, handler functions assigned to a listener

    ```javascript
    const handler = () => console.log("This is a click handler function");
    document.addEventListener("click", handler);
    ```

12. ### What is a first order function

    First-order function is a function that doesn’t accept another function as an argument and doesn’t return a function as its return value.

    ```javascript
    const firstOrder = () => console.log("I am a first order function!");
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

13. ### What is a higher order function

    Higher-order function is a function that accepts another function as an argument or returns a function as a return value or both.

    ```javascript
    const firstOrderFunc = () =>
      console.log("Hello, I am a First order function");
    const higherOrder = (ReturnFirstOrderFunc) => ReturnFirstOrderFunc();
    higherOrder(firstOrderFunc);
    ```

14. ### What is a unary function

    Unary function (i.e. monadic) is a function that accepts exactly one argument. It stands for a single argument accepted by a function.

    Let us take an example of unary function,

    ```javascript
    const unaryFunction = (a) => console.log(a + 10); // Add 10 to the given argument and display the value
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

15. ### What is the currying function

    Currying is the process of taking a function with multiple arguments and turning it into a sequence of functions each with only a single argument. Currying is named after a mathematician **Haskell Curry**. By applying currying, a n-ary function turns it into a unary function.

    Let's take an example of n-ary function and how it turns into a currying function,

    ```javascript
    const multiArgFunction = (a, b, c) => a + b + c;
    console.log(multiArgFunction(1, 2, 3)); // 6

    const curryUnaryFunction = (a) => (b) => (c) => a + b + c;
    curryUnaryFunction(1); // returns a function: b => c =>  1 + b + c
    curryUnaryFunction(1)(2); // returns a function: c => 3 + c
    curryUnaryFunction(1)(2)(3); // returns the number 6
    ```

    Curried functions are great to improve **code reusability** and **functional composition**.

16. ### What is a pure function

    A **Pure function** is a function where the return value is only determined by its arguments without any side effects. i.e, If you call a function with the same arguments 'n' number of times and 'n' number of places in the application then it will always return the same value.

    Let's take an example to see the difference between pure and impure functions,

    ```javascript
    //Impure
    let numberArray = [];
    const impureAddNumber = (number) => numberArray.push(number);
    //Pure
    const pureAddNumber = (number) => (argNumberArray) =>
      argNumberArray.concat([number]);

    //Display the results
    console.log(impureAddNumber(6)); // returns 1
    console.log(numberArray); // returns [6]
    console.log(pureAddNumber(7)(numberArray)); // returns [6, 7]
    console.log(numberArray); // returns [6]
    ```

    As per the above code snippets, the **Push** function is impure itself by altering the array and returning a push number index independent of the parameter value. . Whereas **Concat** on the other hand takes the array and concatenates it with the other array producing a whole new array without side effects. Also, the return value is a concatenation of the previous array.

    Remember that Pure functions are important as they simplify unit testing without any side effects and no need for dependency injection. They also avoid tight coupling and make it harder to break your application by not having any side effects. These principles are coming together with **Immutability** concept of ES6 by giving preference to **const** over **let** usage.

17. ### What is the purpose of the let keyword

    The `let` statement declares a **block scope local variable**. Hence the variables defined with let keyword are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression on which it is used. Whereas variables declared with the `var` keyword used to define a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope.

    Let's take an example to demonstrate the usage,

    ```javascript
    let counter = 30;
    if (counter === 30) {
      let counter = 31;
      console.log(counter); // 31
    }
    console.log(counter); // 30 (because the variable in if block won't exist here)
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

18. ### What is the difference between let and var

    You can list out the differences in a tabular format

    | var                                                   | let                         |
    | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
    | It is been available from the beginning of JavaScript | Introduced as part of ES6   |
    | It has function scope                                 | It has block scope          |
    | Variables will be hoisted                             | Hoisted but not initialized |

    Let's take an example to see the difference,

    ```javascript
    function userDetails(username) {
      if (username) {
        console.log(salary); // undefined due to hoisting
        console.log(age); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'age' before initialization
        let age = 30;
        var salary = 10000;
      }
      console.log(salary); //10000 (accessible to due function scope)
      console.log(age); //error: age is not defined(due to block scope)
    }
    userDetails("John");
    ```

19. ### What is the reason to choose the name let as a keyword

    `let` is a mathematical statement that was adopted by early programming languages like **Scheme** and **Basic**. It has been borrowed from dozens of other languages that use `let` already as a traditional keyword as close to `var` as possible.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

20. ### How do you redeclare variables in switch block without an error

    If you try to redeclare variables in a `switch block` then it will cause errors because there is only one block. For example, the below code block throws a syntax error as below,

    ```javascript
    let counter = 1;
    switch (x) {
      case 0:
        let name;
        break;

      case 1:
        let name; // SyntaxError for redeclaration.
        break;
    }
    ```

    To avoid this error, you can create a nested block inside a case clause and create a new block scoped lexical environment.

    ```javascript
    let counter = 1;
    switch (x) {
      case 0: {
        let name;
        break;
      }
      case 1: {
        let name; // No SyntaxError for redeclaration.
        break;
      }
    }
    ```

21. ### What is the Temporal Dead Zone

    The Temporal Dead Zone is a behavior in JavaScript that occurs when declaring a variable with the let and const keywords, but not with var. In ECMAScript 6, accessing a `let` or `const` variable before its declaration (within its scope) causes a ReferenceError. The time span when that happens, between the creation of a variable’s binding and its declaration, is called the temporal dead zone.

    Let's see this behavior with an example,

    ```javascript
    function somemethod() {
      console.log(counter1); // undefined
      console.log(counter2); // ReferenceError
      var counter1 = 1;
      let counter2 = 2;
    }
    ```

22. ### What is IIFE(Immediately Invoked Function Expression)

    IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined. The signature of it would be as below,

    ```javascript
    (function () {
      // logic here
    })();
    ```

    The primary reason to use an IIFE is to obtain data privacy because any variables declared within the IIFE cannot be accessed by the outside world. i.e, If you try to access variables with IIFE then it throws an error as below,

    ```javascript
    (function () {
      var message = "IIFE";
      console.log(message);
    })();
    console.log(message); //Error: message is not defined
    ```

23. ### How do you decode or encode a URL in JavaScript?

    `encodeURI()` function is used to encode an URL. This function requires a URL string as a parameter and return that encoded string.
    `decodeURI()` function is used to decode an URL. This function requires an encoded URL string as parameter and return that decoded string.

    **Note:** If you want to encode characters such as `/ ? : @ & = + $ #` then you need to use `encodeURIComponent()`.

    ```javascript
    let uri = "employeeDetails?name=john&occupation=manager";
    let encoded_uri = encodeURI(uri);
    let decoded_uri = decodeURI(encoded_uri);
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

24. ### What is memoization

    Memoization is a programming technique which attempts to increase a function’s performance by caching its previously computed results. Each time a memoized function is called, its parameters are used to index the cache. If the data is present, then it can be returned, without executing the entire function. Otherwise the function is executed and then the result is added to the cache.
    Let's take an example of adding function with memoization,

    ```javascript
    const memoizAddition = () => {
      let cache = {};
      return (value) => {
        if (value in cache) {
          console.log("Fetching from cache");
          return cache[value]; // Here, cache.value cannot be used as property name starts with the number which is not a valid JavaScript  identifier. Hence, can only be accessed using the square bracket notation.
        } else {
          console.log("Calculating result");
          let result = value + 20;
          cache[value] = result;
          return result;
        }
      };
    };
    // returned function from memoizAddition
    const addition = memoizAddition();
    console.log(addition(20)); //output: 40 calculated
    console.log(addition(20)); //output: 40 cached
    ```

25. ### What is Hoisting

    Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables, function declarations and classes are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. Remember that JavaScript only hoists declarations, not initialisation.
    Let's take a simple example of variable hoisting,

    ```javascript
    console.log(message); //output : undefined
    var message = "The variable Has been hoisted";
    ```

    The above code looks like as below to the interpreter,

    ```javascript
    var message;
    console.log(message);
    message = "The variable Has been hoisted";
    ```

    In the same fashion, function declarations are hoisted too

    ```javascript
    message("Good morning"); //Good morning

    function message(name) {
      console.log(name);
    }
    ```

    This hoisting makes functions to be safely used in code before they are declared.

26. ### What are classes in ES6

    In ES6, Javascript classes are primarily syntactic sugar over JavaScript’s existing prototype-based inheritance.
    For example, the prototype based inheritance written in function expression as below,

    ```javascript
    function Bike(model, color) {
      this.model = model;
      this.color = color;
    }

    Bike.prototype.getDetails = function () {
      return this.model + " bike has" + this.color + " color";
    };
    ```

    Whereas ES6 classes can be defined as an alternative

    ```javascript
    class Bike {
      constructor(color, model) {
        this.color = color;
        this.model = model;
      }

      getDetails() {
        return this.model + " bike has" + this.color + " color";
      }
    }
    ```

27. ### What are closures

    A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. i.e, It is an inner function that has access to the outer or enclosing function’s variables. The closure has three scope chains

    1. Own scope where variables defined between its curly brackets
    2. Outer function’s variables
    3. Global variables

    Let's take an example of closure concept,

    ```javascript
    function Welcome(name) {
      var greetingInfo = function (message) {
        console.log(message + " " + name);
      };
      return greetingInfo;
    }
    var myFunction = Welcome("John");
    myFunction("Welcome "); //Output: Welcome John
    myFunction("Hello Mr."); //output: Hello Mr.John
    ```

    As per the above code, the inner function(i.e, greetingInfo) has access to the variables in the outer function scope(i.e, Welcome) even after the outer function has returned.

28. ### What are modules

    Modules refer to small units of independent, reusable code and also act as the foundation of many JavaScript design patterns. Most of the JavaScript modules export an object literal, a function, or a constructor

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

29. ### Why do you need modules

    Below are the list of benefits using modules in javascript ecosystem

30. ### What is scope in javascript

    Scope is the accessibility of variables, functions, and objects in some particular part of your code during runtime. In other words, scope determines the visibility of variables and other resources in areas of your code.

31. ### What is a service worker

    A Service worker is basically a script (JavaScript file) that runs in the background, separate from a web page and provides features that don't need a web page or user interaction. Some of the major features of service workers are Rich offline experiences(offline first web application development), periodic background syncs, push notifications, intercept and handle network requests and programmatically managing a cache of responses.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

32. ### How do you manipulate DOM using a service worker

    Service worker can't access the DOM directly. But it can communicate with the pages it controls by responding to messages sent via the `postMessage` interface, and those pages can manipulate the DOM.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

33. ### How do you reuse information across service worker restarts

    The problem with service worker is that it gets terminated when not in use, and restarted when it's next needed, so you cannot rely on global state within a service worker's `onfetch` and `onmessage` handlers. In this case, service workers will have access to IndexedDB API in order to persist and reuse across restarts.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

34. ### What is IndexedDB

    IndexedDB is a low-level API for client-side storage of larger amounts of structured data, including files/blobs. This API uses indexes to enable high-performance searches of this data.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

35. ### What is web storage

    Web storage is an API that provides a mechanism by which browsers can store key/value pairs locally within the user's browser, in a much more intuitive fashion than using cookies. The web storage provides two mechanisms for storing data on the client.

    1. **Local storage:** It stores data for current origin with no expiration date.
    2. **Session storage:** It stores data for one session and the data is lost when the browser tab is closed.

36. ### What is a post message

    Post message is a method that enables cross-origin communication between Window objects.(i.e, between a page and a pop-up that it spawned, or between a page and an iframe embedded within it). Generally, scripts on different pages are allowed to access each other if and only if the pages follow same-origin policy(i.e, pages share the same protocol, port number, and host).

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

37. ### What is a Cookie

    A cookie is a piece of data that is stored on your computer to be accessed by your browser. Cookies are saved as key/value pairs.
    For example, you can create a cookie named username as below,

    ```javascript
    document.cookie = "username=John";
    ```

    ![Screenshot](images/cookie.png)

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

38. ### Why do you need a Cookie

    Cookies are used to remember information about the user profile(such as username). It basically involves two steps,

    1. When a user visits a web page, the user profile can be stored in a cookie.
    2. Next time the user visits the page, the cookie remembers the user profile.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

39. ### What are the options in a cookie

    There are few below options available for a cookie,

    1. By default, the cookie is deleted when the browser is closed but you can change this behavior by setting expiry date (in UTC time).

    ```javascript
    document.cookie = "username=John; expires=Sat, 8 Jun 2019 12:00:00 UTC";
    ```

    1. By default, the cookie belongs to a current page. But you can tell the browser what path the cookie belongs to using a path parameter.

    ```javascript
    document.cookie = "username=John; path=/services";
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

40. ### How do you delete a cookie

    You can delete a cookie by setting the expiry date as a passed date. You don't need to specify a cookie value in this case.
    For example, you can delete a username cookie in the current page as below.

    ```javascript
    document.cookie =
      "username=; expires=Fri, 07 Jun 2019 00:00:00 UTC; path=/;";
    ```

    **Note:** You should define the cookie path option to ensure that you delete the right cookie. Some browsers doesn't allow to delete a cookie unless you specify a path parameter.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

41. ### What are the differences between cookie, local storage and session storage

    Below are some of the differences between cookie, local storage and session storage,

    | Feature                           | Cookie                             | Local storage    | Session storage     |
    | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
    | Accessed on client or server side | Both server-side & client-side     | client-side only | client-side only    |
    | Lifetime                          | As configured using Expires option | until deleted    | until tab is closed |
    | SSL support                       | Supported                          | Not supported    | Not supported       |
    | Maximum data size                 | 4KB                                | 5 MB             | 5MB                 |

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

42. ### What is the main difference between localStorage and sessionStorage

    LocalStorage is the same as SessionStorage but it persists the data even when the browser is closed and reopened(i.e it has no expiration time) whereas in sessionStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

43. ### How do you access web storage

    The Window object implements the `WindowLocalStorage` and `WindowSessionStorage` objects which has `localStorage`(window.localStorage) and `sessionStorage`(window.sessionStorage) properties respectively. These properties create an instance of the Storage object, through which data items can be set, retrieved and removed for a specific domain and storage type (session or local).
    For example, you can read and write on local storage objects as below

    ```javascript
    localStorage.setItem("logo", document.getElementById("logo").value);
    localStorage.getItem("logo");
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**




46. ### Why do you need web storage

    Web storage is more secure, and large amounts of data can be stored locally, without affecting website performance. Also, the information is never transferred to the server. Hence this is a more recommended approach than Cookies.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

47. ### How do you check web storage browser support

    You need to check browser support for localStorage and sessionStorage before using web storage,

    ```javascript
    if (typeof Storage !== "undefined") {
      // Code for localStorage/sessionStorage.
    } else {
      // Sorry! No Web Storage support..
    }
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

48. ### How do you check web workers browser support

    You need to check browser support for web workers before using it

    ```javascript
    if (typeof Worker !== "undefined") {
      // code for Web worker support.
    } else {
      // Sorry! No Web Worker support..
    }
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**



   

50. ### What are the restrictions of web workers on DOM

    WebWorkers don't have access to below javascript objects since they are defined in an external files

    1. Window object
    2. Document object
    3. Parent object

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

51. ### What is a promise

    A promise is an object that may produce a single value some time in the future with either a resolved value or a reason that it’s not resolved(for example, network error). It will be in one of the 3 possible states: fulfilled, rejected, or pending.

    The syntax of Promise creation looks like below,

    ```javascript
    const promise = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
      // promise description
    });
    ```

    The usage of a promise would be as below,

    ```javascript
    const promise = new Promise(
      (resolve) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
          resolve("I'm a Promise!");
        }, 5000);
      },
      (reject) => {}
    );

    promise.then((value) => console.log(value));
    ```

    The action flow of a promise will be as below,

    ![Screenshot](images/promises.png)

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

52. ### Why do you need a promise

    Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations. They provide an alternative approach for callbacks by reducing the callback hell and writing the cleaner code.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

53. ### What are the three states of promise

    Promises have three states:

    1. **Pending:** This is an initial state of the Promise before an operation begins
    2. **Fulfilled:** This state indicates that the specified operation was completed.
    3. **Rejected:** This state indicates that the operation did not complete. In this case an error value will be thrown.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

54. ### What is a callback function

    A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument. This function is invoked inside the outer function to complete an action.
    Let's take a simple example of how to use callback function

    ```javascript
    function callbackFunction(name) {
      console.log("Hello " + name);
    }

    function outerFunction(callback) {
      let name = prompt("Please enter your name.");
      callback(name);
    }

    outerFunction(callbackFunction);
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

55. ### Why do we need callbacks

    The callbacks are needed because javascript is an event driven language. That means instead of waiting for a response javascript will keep executing while listening for other events.
    Let's take an example with the first function invoking an API call(simulated by setTimeout) and the next function which logs the message.

    ```javascript
    function firstFunction() {
      // Simulate a code delay
      setTimeout(function () {
        console.log("First function called");
      }, 1000);
    }
    function secondFunction() {
      console.log("Second function called");
    }
    firstFunction();
    secondFunction();

    Output;
    // Second function called
    // First function called
    ```

    As observed from the output, javascript didn't wait for the response of the first function and the remaining code block got executed. So callbacks are used in a way to make sure that certain code doesn’t execute until the other code finishes execution.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

56. ### What is a callback hell

    Callback Hell is an anti-pattern with multiple nested callbacks which makes code hard to read and debug when dealing with asynchronous logic. The callback hell looks like below,

    ```javascript
    async1(function(){
        async2(function(){
            async3(function(){
                async4(function(){
                    ....
                });
            });
        });
    });
    ```

57. ### What are server-sent events

    Server-sent events (SSE) is a server push technology enabling a browser to receive automatic updates from a server via HTTP connection without resorting to polling. These are a one way communications channel - events flow from server to client only. This has been used in Facebook/Twitter updates, stock price updates, news feeds etc.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

58. ### How do you receive server-sent event notifications

    The EventSource object is used to receive server-sent event notifications. For example, you can receive messages from server as below,

    ```javascript
    if (typeof EventSource !== "undefined") {
      var source = new EventSource("sse_generator.js");
      source.onmessage = function (event) {
        document.getElementById("output").innerHTML += event.data + "<br>";
      };
    }
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

59. ### How do you check browser support for server-sent events

    You can perform browser support for server-sent events before using it as below,

    ```javascript
    if (typeof EventSource !== "undefined") {
      // Server-sent events supported. Let's have some code here!
    } else {
      // No server-sent events supported
    }
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

60. ### What are the events available for server sent events

    Below are the list of events available for server sent events
    | Event | Description |
    |---- | ---------
    | onopen | It is used when a connection to the server is opened |
    | onmessage | This event is used when a message is received |
    | onerror | It happens when an error occurs|

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

61. ### What are the main rules of promise

    A promise must follow a specific set of rules:

    1. A promise is an object that supplies a standard-compliant `.then()` method
    2. A pending promise may transition into either fulfilled or rejected state
    3. A fulfilled or rejected promise is settled and it must not transition into any other state.
    4. Once a promise is settled, the value must not change.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

62. ### What is callback in callback

    You can nest one callback inside in another callback to execute the actions sequentially one by one. This is known as callbacks in callbacks.

    ```javascript
    loadScript("/script1.js", function (script) {
      console.log("first script is loaded");

      loadScript("/script2.js", function (script) {
        console.log("second script is loaded");

        loadScript("/script3.js", function (script) {
          console.log("third script is loaded");
          // after all scripts are loaded
        });
      });
    });
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

63. ### What is promise chaining

    The process of executing a sequence of asynchronous tasks one after another using promises is known as Promise chaining. Let's take an example of promise chaining for calculating the final result,

    ```javascript
    new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
      setTimeout(() => resolve(1), 1000);
    })
      .then(function (result) {
        console.log(result); // 1
        return result * 2;
      })
      .then(function (result) {
        console.log(result); // 2
        return result * 3;
      })
      .then(function (result) {
        console.log(result); // 6
        return result * 4;
      });
    ```

    In the above handlers, the result is passed to the chain of .then() handlers with the below work flow,

    1. The initial promise resolves in 1 second,
    2. After that `.then` handler is called by logging the result(1) and then return a promise with the value of result \* 2.
    3. After that the value passed to the next `.then` handler by logging the result(2) and return a promise with result \* 3.
    4. Finally the value passed to the last `.then` handler by logging the result(6) and return a promise with result \* 4.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

64. ### What is promise.all

    Promise.all is a promise that takes an array of promises as an input (an iterable), and it gets resolved when all the promises get resolved or any one of them gets rejected. For example, the syntax of promise.all method is below,

    ```javascript
    Promise.all([Promise1, Promise2, Promise3]) .then(result) => {   console.log(result) }) .catch(error => console.log(`Error in promises ${error}`))
    ```

    **Note:** Remember that the order of the promises(output the result) is maintained as per input order.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

65. ### What is the purpose of the race method in promise

    Promise.race() method will return the promise instance which is firstly resolved or rejected. Let's take an example of race() method where promise2 is resolved first

    ```javascript
    var promise1 = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
      setTimeout(resolve, 500, "one");
    });
    var promise2 = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
      setTimeout(resolve, 100, "two");
    });

    Promise.race([promise1, promise2]).then(function (value) {
      console.log(value); // "two" // Both promises will resolve, but promise2 is faster
    });
    ```

66. ### What is a strict mode in javascript

    Strict Mode is a new feature in ECMAScript 5 that allows you to place a program, or a function, in a “strict” operating context. This way it prevents certain actions from being taken and throws more exceptions. The literal expression `"use strict";` instructs the browser to use the javascript code in the Strict mode.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

67. ### Why do you need strict mode

    Strict mode is useful to write "secure" JavaScript by notifying "bad syntax" into real errors. For example, it eliminates accidentally creating a global variable by throwing an error and also throws an error for assignment to a non-writable property, a getter-only property, a non-existing property, a non-existing variable, or a non-existing object.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

68. ### How do you declare strict mode

    The strict mode is declared by adding "use strict"; to the beginning of a script or a function.
    If declared at the beginning of a script, it has global scope.

    ```javascript
    "use strict";
    x = 3.14; // This will cause an error because x is not declared
    ```

    and if you declare inside a function, it has local scope

    ```javascript
    x = 3.14; // This will not cause an error.
    myFunction();

    function myFunction() {
      "use strict";
      y = 3.14; // This will cause an error
    }
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

69. ### What is the purpose of double exclamation

    The double exclamation or negation(!!) ensures the resulting type is a boolean. If it was falsey (e.g. 0, null, undefined, etc.), it will be false, otherwise, it will be true.
    For example, you can test IE version using this expression as below,

    ```javascript
    let isIE8 = false;
    isIE8 = !!navigator.userAgent.match(/MSIE 8.0/);
    console.log(isIE8); // returns true or false
    ```

    If you don't use this expression then it returns the original value.

    ```javascript
    console.log(navigator.userAgent.match(/MSIE 8.0/)); // returns either an Array or null
    ```

    **Note:** The expression !! is not an operator, but it is just twice of ! operator.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

70. ### What is the purpose of the delete operator

    The delete keyword is used to delete the property as well as its value.

    ```javascript
    var user = { name: "John", age: 20 };
    delete user.age;

    console.log(user); // {name: "John"}
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

71. ### What is typeof operator

    You can use the JavaScript typeof operator to find the type of a JavaScript variable. It returns the type of a variable or an expression.

    ```javascript
    typeof "John Abraham"; // Returns "string"
    typeof (1 + 2); // Returns "number"
    typeof [1, 2, 3] // Returns "object" because all arrays are also objects
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

72. ### What is undefined property

    The undefined property indicates that a variable has not been assigned a value, or declared but not initialized at all. The type of undefined value is undefined too.

    ```javascript
    var user; // Value is undefined, type is undefined
    console.log(typeof user); //undefined
    ```

    Any variable can be emptied by setting the value to undefined.

    ```javascript
    user = undefined;
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

73. ### What is null value

    The value null represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is one of JavaScript's primitive values. The type of null value is object.
    You can empty the variable by setting the value to null.

    ```javascript
    var user = null;
    console.log(typeof user); //object
    ```

74. ### What is the difference between null and undefined

    Below are the main differences between null and undefined,

    | Null                                                                                            | Undefined                                                                                               |
    | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | It is an assignment value which indicates that variable points to no object.                    | It is not an assignment value where a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. |
    | Type of null is object                                                                          | Type of undefined is undefined                                                                          |
    | The null value is a primitive value that represents the null, empty, or non-existent reference. | The undefined value is a primitive value used when a variable has not been assigned a value.            |
    | Indicates the absence of a value for a variable                                                 | Indicates absence of variable itself                                                                    |
    | Converted to zero (0) while performing primitive operations                                     | Converted to NaN while performing primitive operations                                                  |

76. ### What is the difference between window and document

    Below are the main differences between window and document,

    | Window                                                                        | Document                                                                                      |

    | It is the root level element in any web page                                  | It is the direct child of the window object. This is also known as Document Object Model(DOM) |
    | By default window object is available implicitly in the page                  | You can access it via window.document or document.                                            |
    | It has methods like alert(), confirm() and properties like document, location | It provides methods like getElementById, getElementsByTagName, createElement etc              |

77. ### How do you access history in javascript

    The window.history object contains the browser's history. You can load previous and next URLs in the history using back() and next() methods.

    ```javascript
    function goBack() {
      window.history.back();
    }
    function goForward() {
      window.history.forward();
    }
    ```

    **Note:** You can also access history without window prefix.

79. ### What is isNaN

    The isNaN() function is used to determine whether a value is an illegal number (Not-a-Number) or not. i.e, This function returns true if the value equates to NaN. Otherwise it returns false.

    ```javascript
    isNaN("Hello"); //true
    isNaN("100"); //false
    ```

80. ### What are the differences between undeclared and undefined variables

    Below are the major differences between undeclared(not defined) and undefined variables,

    | undeclared                                                                                  | undefined                                                                              |
    | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | These variables do not exist in a program and are not declared                              | These variables declared in the program but have not assigned any value                |
    | If you try to read the value of an undeclared variable, then a runtime error is encountered | If you try to read the value of an undefined variable, an undefined value is returned. |

81. ### What are global variables

    Global variables are those that are available throughout the length of the code without any scope. The var keyword is used to declare a local variable but if you omit it then it will become global variable

    ```javascript
    msg = "Hello"; // var is missing, it becomes global variable
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

82. ### What are the problems with global variables

    The problem with global variables is the conflict of variable names of local and global scope. It is also difficult to debug and test the code that relies on global variables.

83. ### What is NaN property

    The NaN property is a global property that represents "Not-a-Number" value. i.e, It indicates that a value is not a legal number. It is very rare to use NaN in a program but it can be used as return value for few cases

    ```javascript
    Math.sqrt(-1);
    parseInt("Hello");
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

84. ### What is the purpose of isFinite function

    The isFinite() function is used to determine whether a number is a finite, legal number. It returns false if the value is +infinity, -infinity, or NaN (Not-a-Number), otherwise it returns true.

    ```javascript
    isFinite(Infinity); // false
    isFinite(NaN); // false
    isFinite(-Infinity); // false

    isFinite(100); // true
    ```

85. ### What is an event flow

    Event flow is the order in which event is received on the web page. When you click an element that is nested in various other elements, before your click actually reaches its destination, or target element, it must trigger the click event for each of its parent elements first, starting at the top with the global window object.
    There are two ways of event flow

    1. Top to Bottom(Event Capturing)
    2. Bottom to Top (Event Bubbling)

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

86. ### What is event bubbling

    Event bubbling is a type of event propagation where the event first triggers on the innermost target element, and then successively triggers on the ancestors (parents) of the target element in the same nesting hierarchy till it reaches the outermost DOM element.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

87. ### What is event capturing

    Event capturing is a type of event propagation where the event is first captured by the outermost element, and then successively triggers on the descendants (children) of the target element in the same nesting hierarchy till it reaches the innermost DOM element.

88. ### How do you submit a form using JavaScript

    You can submit a form using `document.forms[0].submit()`. All the form input's information is submitted using onsubmit event handler

    ```javascript
    function submit() {
      document.forms[0].submit();
    }
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

89. ### How do you find operating system details

    The window.navigator object contains information about the visitor's browser OS details. Some of the OS properties are available under platform property,

    ```javascript
    console.log(navigator.platform);
    ```

90. ### What is the difference between document load and DOMContentLoaded events

    The `DOMContentLoaded` event is fired when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for assets(stylesheets, images, and subframes) to finish loading. Whereas The load event is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources(stylesheets, images).

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

91. ### What is the difference between native, host and user objects

    `Native objects` are objects that are part of the JavaScript language defined by the ECMAScript specification. For example, String, Math, RegExp, Object, Function etc core objects defined in the ECMAScript spec.
    `Host objects` are objects provided by the browser or runtime environment (Node). For example, window, XmlHttpRequest, DOM nodes etc are considered as host objects.
    `User objects` are objects defined in the javascript code. For example, User objects created for profile information.

92. ### What are the tools or techniques used for debugging JavaScript code

    You can use below tools or techniques for debugging javascript

    1. Chrome Devtools
    2. debugger statement
    3. Good old console.log statement

93. ### What are the pros and cons of promises over callbacks

    Below are the list of pros and cons of promises over callbacks,

    **Pros:**

    1. It avoids callback hell which is unreadable
    2. Easy to write sequential asynchronous code with .then()
    3. Easy to write parallel asynchronous code with Promise.all()
    4. Solves some of the common problems of callbacks(call the callback too late, too early, many times and swallow errors/exceptions)

    **Cons:**

    1. It makes little complex code
    2. You need to load a polyfill if ES6 is not supported

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

94. ### What is the difference between an attribute and a property

    Attributes are defined on the HTML markup whereas properties are defined on the DOM. For example, the below HTML element has 2 attributes type and value,

    ```javascript
    <input type="text" value="Name:">
    ```

    You can retrieve the attribute value as below,

    ```javascript
    const input = document.querySelector("input");
    console.log(input.getAttribute("value")); // Good morning
    console.log(input.value); // Good morning
    ```

    And after you change the value of the text field to "Good evening", it becomes like

    ```javascript
    console.log(input.getAttribute("value")); // Good evening
    console.log(input.value); // Good evening
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**



96. ### What is the purpose of void 0

    Void(0) is used to prevent the page from refreshing. This will be helpful to eliminate the unwanted side-effect, because it will return the undefined primitive value. It is commonly used for HTML documents that use href="JavaScript:Void(0);" within an `<a>` element. i.e, when you click a link, the browser loads a new page or refreshes the same page. But this behavior will be prevented using this expression.
    For example, the below link notify the message without reloading the page

    ```javascript
    <a href="JavaScript:void(0);" onclick="alert('Well done!')">
      Click Me!
    </a>
    ```

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

97. ### Is JavaScript a compiled or interpreted language

    JavaScript is an interpreted language, not a compiled language. An interpreter in the browser reads over the JavaScript code, interprets each line, and runs it. Nowadays modern browsers use a technology known as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which compiles JavaScript to executable bytecode just as it is about to run.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

98. ### Is JavaScript a case-sensitive language

    Yes, JavaScript is a case sensitive language. The language keywords, variables, function & object names, and any other identifiers must always be typed with a consistent capitalization of letters.

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

99. ### Is there any relation between Java and JavaScript

    No, they are entirely two different programming languages and have nothing to do with each other. But both of them are Object Oriented Programming languages and like many other languages, they follow similar syntax for basic features(if, else, for, switch, break, continue etc).

    **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

100. ### What are events

     Events are "things" that happen to HTML elements. When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can `react` on these events. Some of the examples of HTML events are,

     1. Web page has finished loading
     2. Input field was changed
     3. Button was clicked

     Let's describe the behavior of click event for button element,

     ```javascript
     <!doctype html>
     <html>
      <head>
        <script>
          function greeting() {
            alert('Hello! Good morning');
          }
        </script>
      </head>
      <body>
        <button type="button" onclick="greeting()">Click me</button>
      </body>
     </html>
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

101. ### Who created javascript

     JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 during his time at Netscape Communications. Initially it was developed under the name `Mocha`, but later the language was officially called `LiveScript` when it first shipped in beta releases of Netscape.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

102. ### What is the use of preventDefault method

     The preventDefault() method cancels the event if it is cancelable, meaning that the default action or behaviour that belongs to the event will not occur. For example, prevent form submission when clicking on submit button and prevent opening the page URL when clicking on hyperlink are some common use cases.

     ```javascript
     document
       .getElementById("link")
       .addEventListener("click", function (event) {
         event.preventDefault();
       });
     ```

     **Note:** Remember that not all events are cancelable.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**



104. ### What are the steps involved in return false usage

     The return false statement in event handlers performs the below steps,

     1. First it stops the browser's default action or behaviour.
     2. It prevents the event from propagating the DOM
     3. Stops callback execution and returns immediately when called.

105. ### What is BOM

     The Browser Object Model (BOM) allows JavaScript to "talk to" the browser. It consists of the objects navigator, history, screen, location and document which are children of the window. The Browser Object Model is not standardized and can change based on different browsers.

106. ### What is the use of setTimeout

     The setTimeout() method is used to call a function or evaluate an expression after a specified number of milliseconds. For example, let's log a message after 2 seconds using setTimeout method,

     ```javascript
     setTimeout(function () {
       console.log("Good morning");
     }, 2000);
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

107. ### What is the use of setInterval

     The setInterval() method is used to call a function or evaluate an expression at specified intervals (in milliseconds). For example, let's log a message after 2 seconds using setInterval method,

     ```javascript
     setInterval(function () {
       console.log("Good morning");
     }, 2000);
     ```

108. ### Why is JavaScript treated as Single threaded

     JavaScript is a single-threaded language. Because the language specification does not allow the programmer to write code so that the interpreter can run parts of it in parallel in multiple threads or processes. Whereas languages like java, go, C++ can make multi-threaded and multi-process programs.

111. ### What is JSON

     JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight format that is used for data interchanging. It is based on a subset of JavaScript language in the way objects are built in JavaScript.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

112. ### What are the syntax rules of JSON

     Below are the list of syntax rules of JSON

     1. The data is in name/value pairs
     2. The data is separated by commas
     3. Curly braces hold objects
     4. Square brackets hold arrays

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

113. ### What is the purpose JSON stringify

     When sending data to a web server, the data has to be in a string format. You can achieve this by converting JSON object into a string using stringify() method.

     ```javascript
     var userJSON = { name: "John", age: 31 };
     var userString = JSON.stringify(userJSON);
     console.log(userString); //"{"name":"John","age":31}"
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

114. ### How do you parse JSON string

     When receiving the data from a web server, the data is always in a string format. But you can convert this string value to a javascript object using parse() method.

     ```javascript
     var userString = '{"name":"John","age":31}';
     var userJSON = JSON.parse(userString);
     console.log(userJSON); // {name: "John", age: 31}
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

115. ### Why do you need JSON

     When exchanging data between a browser and a server, the data can only be text. Since JSON is text only, it can easily be sent to and from a server, and used as a data format by any programming language.

117. ### What is the purpose of clearTimeout method

     The clearTimeout() function is used in javascript to clear the timeout which has been set by setTimeout()function before that. i.e, The return value of setTimeout() function is stored in a variable and it’s passed into the clearTimeout() function to clear the timer.

     For example, the below setTimeout method is used to display the message after 3 seconds. This timeout can be cleared by the clearTimeout() method.

     ```javascript
     <script>
     var msg;
     function greeting() {
        alert('Good morning');
     }
     function start() {
       msg =setTimeout(greeting, 3000);

     }

     function stop() {
         clearTimeout(msg);
     }
     </script>
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

118. ### What is the purpose of clearInterval method

     The clearInterval() function is used in javascript to clear the interval which has been set by setInterval() function. i.e, The return value returned by setInterval() function is stored in a variable and it’s passed into the clearInterval() function to clear the interval.

     For example, the below setInterval method is used to display the message for every 3 seconds. This interval can be cleared by the clearInterval() method.

     ```javascript
     <script>
     var msg;
     function greeting() {
        alert('Good morning');
     }
     function start() {
       msg = setInterval(greeting, 3000);

     }

     function stop() {
         clearInterval(msg);
     }
     </script>
     ```

119. ### How do you redirect new page in javascript

     In vanilla javascript, you can redirect to a new page using the `location` property of window object. The syntax would be as follows,

     ```javascript
     function redirect() {
       window.location.href = "newPage.html";
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

120. ### How do you check whether a string contains a substring

     There are 3 possible ways to check whether a string contains a substring or not,

     1. **Using includes:** ES6 provided `String.prototype.includes` method to test a string contains a substring

     ```javascript
     var mainString = "hello",
       subString = "hell";
     mainString.includes(subString);
     ```

     1. **Using indexOf:** In an ES5 or older environment, you can use `String.prototype.indexOf` which returns the index of a substring. If the index value is not equal to -1 then it means the substring exists in the main string.

     ```javascript
     var mainString = "hello",
       subString = "hell";
     mainString.indexOf(subString) !== -1;
     ```

     1. **Using RegEx:** The advanced solution is using Regular expression's test method(`RegExp.test`), which allows for testing for against regular expressions

     ```javascript
     var mainString = "hello",
       regex = /hell/;
     regex.test(mainString);
     ```

121. ### How do you validate an email in javascript

     You can validate an email in javascript using regular expressions. It is recommended to do validations on the server side instead of the client side. Because the javascript can be disabled on the client side.

     ```javascript
     function validateEmail(email) {
       var re =
         /^(([^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+(\.[^<>()\[\]\\.,;:\s@"]+)*)|(".+"))@((\[[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\])|(([a-zA-Z\-0-9]+\.)+[a-zA-Z]{2,}))$/;
       return re.test(String(email).toLowerCase());
     }
     ```

     The above regular expression accepts unicode characters.

122. ### How do you get the current url with javascript

     You can use `window.location.href` expression to get the current url path and you can use the same expression for updating the URL too. You can also use `document.URL` for read-only purposes but this solution has issues in FF.

     ```javascript
     console.log("location.href", window.location.href); // Returns full URL
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

123. ### What are the various url properties of location object

     The below `Location` object properties can be used to access URL components of the page,

     1. href - The entire URL
     2. protocol - The protocol of the URL
     3. host - The hostname and port of the URL
     4. hostname - The hostname of the URL
     5. port - The port number in the URL
     6. pathname - The path name of the URL
     7. search - The query portion of the URL
     8. hash - The anchor portion of the URL

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

124. ### How do get query string values in javascript

     You can use URLSearchParams to get query string values in javascript. Let's see an example to get the client code value from URL query string,

     ```javascript
     const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
     const clientCode = urlParams.get("clientCode");
     ```

125. ### How do you check if a key exists in an object

     You can check whether a key exists in an object or not using three approaches,

     1. **Using in operator:** You can use the in operator whether a key exists in an object or not

     ```javascript
     "key" in obj;
     ```

     and If you want to check if a key doesn't exist, remember to use parenthesis,

     ```javascript
     !("key" in obj);
     ```

     1. **Using hasOwnProperty method:** You can use `hasOwnProperty` to particularly test for properties of the object instance (and not inherited properties)

     ```javascript
     obj.hasOwnProperty("key"); // true
     ```

     1. **Using undefined comparison:** If you access a non-existing property from an object, the result is undefined. Let’s compare the properties against undefined to determine the existence of the property.

     ```javascript
     const user = {
       name: "John",
     };

     console.log(user.name !== undefined); // true
     console.log(user.nickName !== undefined); // false
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

126. ### How do you loop through or enumerate javascript object

     You can use the `for-in` loop to loop through javascript object. You can also make sure that the key you get is an actual property of an object, and doesn't come from the prototype using `hasOwnProperty` method.

     ```javascript
     var object = {
       k1: "value1",
       k2: "value2",
       k3: "value3",
     };

     for (var key in object) {
       if (object.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
         console.log(key + " -> " + object[key]); // k1 -> value1 ...
       }
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

127. ### How do you test for an empty object

     There are different solutions based on ECMAScript versions

     1. **Using Object entries(ECMA 7+):** You can use object entries length along with constructor type.

     ```javascript
     Object.entries(obj).length === 0 && obj.constructor === Object; // Since date object length is 0, you need to check constructor check as well
     ```

     1. **Using Object keys(ECMA 5+):** You can use object keys length along with constructor type.

     ```javascript
     Object.keys(obj).length === 0 && obj.constructor === Object; // Since date object length is 0, you need to check constructor check as well
     ```

     1. **Using for-in with hasOwnProperty(Pre-ECMA 5):** You can use a for-in loop along with hasOwnProperty.

     ```javascript
     function isEmpty(obj) {
       for (var prop in obj) {
         if (obj.hasOwnProperty(prop)) {
           return false;
         }
       }

       return JSON.stringify(obj) === JSON.stringify({});
     }
     ```

128. ### What is an arguments object

     The arguments object is an Array-like object accessible inside functions that contains the values of the arguments passed to that function. For example, let's see how to use arguments object inside sum function,

     ```javascript
     function sum() {
       var total = 0;
       for (var i = 0, len = arguments.length; i < len; ++i) {
         total += arguments[i];
       }
       return total;
     }

     sum(1, 2, 3); // returns 6
     ```

     **Note:** You can't apply array methods on arguments object. But you can convert into a regular array as below.

     ```javascript
     var argsArray = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
     ```

129. ### How do you make first letter of the string in an uppercase

     You can create a function which uses a chain of string methods such as charAt, toUpperCase and slice methods to generate a string with the first letter in uppercase.

     ```javascript
     function capitalizeFirstLetter(string) {
       return string.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + string.slice(1);
     }
     ```

130. ### What are the pros and cons of for loop

     The for-loop is a commonly used iteration syntax in javascript. It has both pros and cons

     #### Pros

     1. Works on every environment
     2. You can use break and continue flow control statements

     #### Cons

     1. Too verbose
     2. Imperative
     3. You might face one-by-off errors

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

131. ### How do you display the current date in javascript

     You can use `new Date()` to generate a new Date object containing the current date and time. For example, let's display the current date in mm/dd/yyyy

     ```javascript
     var today = new Date();
     var dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, "0");
     var mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, "0"); //January is 0!
     var yyyy = today.getFullYear();

     today = mm + "/" + dd + "/" + yyyy;
     document.write(today);
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

132. ### How do you compare two date objects

     You need to use date.getTime() method to compare date values instead of comparison operators (==, !=, ===, and !== operators)

     ```javascript
     var d1 = new Date();
     var d2 = new Date(d1);
     console.log(d1.getTime() === d2.getTime()); //True
     console.log(d1 === d2); // False
     ```

133. ### How do you check if a string starts with another string

     You can use ECMAScript 6's `String.prototype.startsWith()` method to check if a string starts with another string or not. But it is not yet supported in all browsers. Let's see an example to see this usage,

     ```javascript
     "Good morning".startsWith("Good"); // true
     "Good morning".startsWith("morning"); // false
     ```

134. ### How do you trim a string in javascript

     JavaScript provided a trim method on string types to trim any whitespaces present at the beginning or ending of the string.

     ```javascript
     "  Hello World   ".trim(); //Hello World
     ```

     If your browser(<IE9) doesn't support this method then you can use below polyfill.

     ```javascript
     if (!String.prototype.trim) {
       (function () {
         // Make sure we trim BOM and NBSP
         var rtrim = /^[\s\uFEFF\xA0]+|[\s\uFEFF\xA0]+$/g;
         String.prototype.trim = function () {
           return this.replace(rtrim, "");
         };
       })();
     }
     ```

135. ### How do you add a key value pair in javascript

     There are two possible solutions to add new properties to an object. Let's take a simple object to explain these solutions.

     ```javascript
     var object = {
       key1: value1,
       key2: value2,
     };
     ```

     1. **Using dot notation:** This solution is useful when you know the name of the property

     ```javascript
     object.key3 = "value3";
     ```

     1. **Using square bracket notation:** This solution is useful when the name of the property is dynamically determined.

     ```javascript
     obj["key3"] = "value3";
     ```

136. ### Is the !-- notation represents a special operator

     No,that's not a special operator. But it is a combination of 2 standard operators one after the other,

     1. A logical not (!)
     2. A prefix decrement (--)

     At first, the value decremented by one and then tested to see if it is equal to zero or not for determining the truthy/falsy value.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

137. ### How do you assign default values to variables

     You can use the logical or operator `||` in an assignment expression to provide a default value. The syntax looks like as below,

     ```javascript
     var a = b || c;
     ```

     As per the above expression, variable 'a 'will get the value of 'c' only if 'b' is falsy (if is null, false, undefined, 0, empty string, or NaN), otherwise 'a' will get the value of 'b'.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

138. ### How do you define multiline strings

     You can define multiline string literals using the '\\' character followed by line terminator.

     ```javascript
     var str =
       "This is a \
     very lengthy \
     sentence!";
     ```

     But if you have a space after the '\\' character, the code will look exactly the same, but it will raise a SyntaxError.

139. ### What is an app shell model

     An application shell (or app shell) architecture is one way to build a Progressive Web App that reliably and instantly loads on your users' screens, similar to what you see in native applications. It is useful for getting some initial HTML to the screen fast without a network.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

140. ### Can we define properties for functions

     Yes, We can define properties for functions because functions are also objects.

     ```javascript
     fn = function (x) {
       //Function code goes here
     };

     fn.name = "John";

     fn.profile = function (y) {
       //Profile code goes here
     };
     ```

141. ### What is the way to find the number of parameters expected by a function

     You can use `function.length` syntax to find the number of parameters expected by a function. Let's take an example of `sum` function to calculate the sum of numbers,

     ```javascript
     function sum(num1, num2, num3, num4) {
       return num1 + num2 + num3 + num4;
     }
     sum.length; // 4 is the number of parameters expected.
     ```

142. ### What is a polyfill

     A polyfill is a piece of JS code used to provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it. For example, Silverlight plugin polyfill can be used to mimic the functionality of an HTML Canvas element on Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

143. ### What are break and continue statements

     The break statement is used to "jump out" of a loop. i.e, It breaks the loop and continues executing the code after the loop.

     ```javascript
     for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
       if (i === 5) {
         break;
       }
       text += "Number: " + i + "<br>";
     }
     ```

     The continue statement is used to "jump over" one iteration in the loop. i.e, It breaks one iteration (in the loop), if a specified condition occurs, and continues with the next iteration in the loop.

     ```javascript
     for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
       if (i === 5) {
         continue;
       }
       text += "Number: " + i + "<br>";
     }
     ```

144. ### What are js labels

     The label statement allows us to name loops and blocks in JavaScript. We can then use these labels to refer back to the code later. For example, the below code with labels avoids printing the numbers when they are same,

     ```javascript
     var i, j;

     loop1: for (i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
       loop2: for (j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
         if (i === j) {
           continue loop1;
         }
         console.log("i = " + i + ", j = " + j);
       }
     }

     // Output is:
     //   "i = 1, j = 0"
     //   "i = 2, j = 0"
     //   "i = 2, j = 1"
     ```

145. ### What are the benefits of keeping declarations at the top

     It is recommended to keep all declarations at the top of each script or function. The benefits of doing this are,

     1. Gives cleaner code
     2. It provides a single place to look for local variables
     3. Easy to avoid unwanted global variables
     4. It reduces the possibility of unwanted re-declarations

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

146. ### What are the benefits of initializing variables

     It is recommended to initialize variables because of the below benefits,

     1. It gives cleaner code
     2. It provides a single place to initialize variables
     3. Avoid undefined values in the code

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

147. ### What are the recommendations to create new object

     It is recommended to avoid creating new objects using `new Object()`. Instead you can initialize values based on it's type to create the objects.

     1. Assign {} instead of new Object()
     2. Assign "" instead of new String()
     3. Assign 0 instead of new Number()
     4. Assign false instead of new Boolean()
     5. Assign [] instead of new Array()
     6. Assign /()/ instead of new RegExp()
     7. Assign function (){} instead of new Function()

     You can define them as an example,

     ```javascript
     var v1 = {};
     var v2 = "";
     var v3 = 0;
     var v4 = false;
     var v5 = [];
     var v6 = /()/;
     var v7 = function () {};
     ```

148. ### How do you define JSON arrays

     JSON arrays are written inside square brackets and arrays contain javascript objects. For example, the JSON array of users would be as below,

     ```javascript
     "users":[
       {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Abrahm"},
       {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
       {"firstName":"Shane", "lastName":"Warn"}
     ]
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

149. ### How do you generate random integers

     You can use Math.random() with Math.floor() to return random integers. For example, if you want generate random integers between 1 to 10, the multiplication factor should be 10,

     ```javascript
     Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1; // returns a random integer from 1 to 10
     Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1; // returns a random integer from 1 to 100
     ```

     **Note:** Math.random() returns a random number between 0 (inclusive), and 1 (exclusive)

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

150. ### Can you write a random integers function to print integers with in a range

     Yes, you can create a proper random function to return a random number between min and max (both included)

     ```javascript
     function randomInteger(min, max) {
       return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min;
     }
     randomInteger(1, 100); // returns a random integer from 1 to 100
     randomInteger(1, 1000); // returns a random integer from 1 to 1000
     ```

151. ### What is tree shaking

     Tree shaking is a form of dead code elimination. It means that unused modules will not be included in the bundle during the build process and for that it relies on the static structure of ES2015 module syntax,( i.e. import and export). Initially this has been popularized by the ES2015 module bundler `rollup`.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

152. ### What is the need of tree shaking

     Tree Shaking can significantly reduce the code size in any application. i.e, The less code we send over the wire the more performant the application will be. For example, if we just want to create a “Hello World” Application using SPA frameworks then it will take around a few MBs, but by tree shaking it can bring down the size to just a few hundred KBs. Tree shaking is implemented in Rollup and Webpack bundlers.

153. ### Is it recommended to use eval

     No, it allows arbitrary code to be run which causes a security problem. As we know that the eval() function is used to run text as code. In most of the cases, it should not be necessary to use it.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

154. ### What is a Regular Expression

     A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. You can use this search pattern for searching data in a text. These can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations. Let's see the syntax format now,

     ```javascript
     /pattern/modifiers;
     ```

     For example, the regular expression or search pattern with case-insensitive username would be,

     ```javascript
     /John/i;
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

155. ### What are the string methods available in Regular expression

     Regular Expressions has two string methods: search() and replace().
     The search() method uses an expression to search for a match, and returns the position of the match.

     ```javascript
     var msg = "Hello John";
     var n = msg.search(/John/i); // 6
     ```

     The replace() method is used to return a modified string where the pattern is replaced.

     ```javascript
     var msg = "Hello John";
     var n = msg.replace(/John/i, "Buttler"); // Hello Buttler
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

156. ### What are modifiers in regular expression

     Modifiers can be used to perform case-insensitive and global searches. Let's list down some of the modifiers,

     | Modifier | Description                                             |
     | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
     | i        | Perform case-insensitive matching                       |
     | g        | Perform a global match rather than stops at first match |
     | m        | Perform multiline matching                              |

     Let's take an example of global modifier,

     ```javascript
     var text = "Learn JS one by one";
     var pattern = /one/g;
     var result = text.match(pattern); // one,one
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

157. ### What are regular expression patterns

     Regular Expressions provide a group of patterns in order to match characters. Basically they are categorized into 3 types,

     1. **Brackets:** These are used to find a range of characters.
        For example, below are some use cases,
        1. [abc]: Used to find any of the characters between the brackets(a,b,c)
        2. [0-9]: Used to find any of the digits between the brackets
        3. (a|b): Used to find any of the alternatives separated with |
     2. **Metacharacters:** These are characters with a special meaning
        For example, below are some use cases,
        1. \\d: Used to find a digit
        2. \\s: Used to find a whitespace character
        3. \\b: Used to find a match at the beginning or ending of a word
     3. **Quantifiers:** These are useful to define quantities
        For example, below are some use cases,
        1. n+: Used to find matches for any string that contains at least one n
        2. n\*: Used to find matches for any string that contains zero or more occurrences of n
        3. n?: Used to find matches for any string that contains zero or one occurrences of n

158. ### What is a RegExp object

     RegExp object is a regular expression object with predefined properties and methods. Let's see the simple usage of RegExp object,

     ```javascript
     var regexp = new RegExp("\\w+");
     console.log(regexp);
     // expected output: /\w+/
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

159. ### How do you search a string for a pattern

     You can use the test() method of regular expression in order to search a string for a pattern, and return true or false depending on the result.

     ```javascript
     var pattern = /you/;
     console.log(pattern.test("How are you?")); //true
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

160. ### What is the purpose of exec method

     The purpose of exec method is similar to test method but it executes a search for a match in a specified string and returns a result array, or null instead of returning true/false.

     ```javascript
     var pattern = /you/;
     console.log(pattern.exec("How are you?")); //["you", index: 8, input: "How are you?", groups: undefined]
     ```

161. ### How do you change the style of a HTML element

     You can change inline style or classname of a HTML element using javascript

     1. **Using style property:** You can modify inline style using style property

     ```javascript
     document.getElementById("title").style.fontSize = "30px";
     ```

     1. **Using ClassName property:** It is easy to modify element class using className property

     ```javascript
     document.getElementById("title").className = "custom-title";
     ```

162. ### What would be the result of 1+2+'3'

     The output is going to be `33`. Since `1` and `2` are numeric values, the result of the first two digits is going to be a numeric value `3`. The next digit is a string type value because of that the addition of numeric value `3` and string type value `3` is just going to be a concatenation value `33`.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

163. ### What is a debugger statement

     The debugger statement invokes any available debugging functionality, such as setting a breakpoint. If no debugging functionality is available, this statement has no effect.
     For example, in the below function a debugger statement has been inserted. So
     execution is paused at the debugger statement just like a breakpoint in the script source.

     ```javascript
     function getProfile() {
       // code goes here
       debugger;
       // code goes here
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

164. ### What is the purpose of breakpoints in debugging

     You can set breakpoints in the javascript code once the debugger statement is executed and the debugger window pops up. At each breakpoint, javascript will stop executing, and let you examine the JavaScript values. After examining values, you can resume the execution of code using the play button.

165. ### Can I use reserved words as identifiers

     No, you cannot use the reserved words as variables, labels, object or function names. Let's see one simple example,

     ```javascript
     var else = "hello"; // Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token else
     ```

167. ### How do you detect a mobile browser without regexp

     You can detect mobile browsers by simply running through a list of devices and checking if the useragent matches anything. This is an alternative solution for RegExp usage,

     ```javascript
     function detectmob() {
       if (
         navigator.userAgent.match(/Android/i) ||
         navigator.userAgent.match(/webOS/i) ||
         navigator.userAgent.match(/iPhone/i) ||
         navigator.userAgent.match(/iPad/i) ||
         navigator.userAgent.match(/iPod/i) ||
         navigator.userAgent.match(/BlackBerry/i) ||
         navigator.userAgent.match(/Windows Phone/i)
       ) {
         return true;
       } else {
         return false;
       }
     }
     ```

     var img = new Image();
     img.onload = function () {
       console.log(this.width + "x" + this.height);
     };
     img.src = "http://www.google.com/intl/en_ALL/images/logo.gif";

169. ### How do you make synchronous HTTP request

     Browsers provide an XMLHttpRequest object which can be used to make synchronous HTTP requests from JavaScript

     ```javascript
     function httpGet(theUrl) {
       var xmlHttpReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
       xmlHttpReq.open("GET", theUrl, false); // false for synchronous request
       xmlHttpReq.send(null);
       return xmlHttpReq.responseText;
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

170. ### How do you make asynchronous HTTP request

     Browsers provide an XMLHttpRequest object which can be used to make asynchronous HTTP requests from JavaScript by passing the 3rd parameter as true.

     ```javascript
     function httpGetAsync(theUrl, callback) {
       var xmlHttpReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
       xmlHttpReq.onreadystatechange = function () {
         if (xmlHttpReq.readyState == 4 && xmlHttpReq.status == 200)
           callback(xmlHttpReq.responseText);
       };
       xmlHttp.open("GET", theUrl, true); // true for asynchronous
       xmlHttp.send(null);
     }

171. ### How do you convert date to another timezone in javascript

     You can use the toLocaleString() method to convert dates in one timezone to another. For example, let's convert current date to British English timezone as below,

     ```javascript
     console.log(event.toLocaleString("en-GB", { timeZone: "UTC" })); //29/06/2019, 09:56:00
     ```

172. ### What are the properties used to get size of window

     You can use innerWidth, innerHeight, clientWidth, clientHeight properties of windows, document element and document body objects to find the size of a window. Let's use them combination of these properties to calculate the size of a window or document,

     ```javascript
     var width =
       window.innerWidth ||
       document.documentElement.clientWidth ||
       document.body.clientWidth;

     var height =
       window.innerHeight ||
       document.documentElement.clientHeight ||
       document.body.clientHeight;
     ```

173. ### What is a conditional operator in javascript

     The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands which acts as a shortcut for if statements.

     ```javascript
     var isAuthenticated = false;
     console.log(
       isAuthenticated ? "Hello, welcome" : "Sorry, you are not authenticated"
     ); //Sorry, you are not authenticated
     ```

174. ### Can you apply chaining on conditional operator

     Yes, you can apply chaining on conditional operators similar to if … else if … else if … else chain. The syntax is going to be as below,

     ```javascript
     function traceValue(someParam) {
       return condition1
         ? value1
         : condition2
         ? value2
         : condition3
         ? value3
         : value4;
     }

     // The above conditional operator is equivalent to:

     function traceValue(someParam) {
       if (condition1) {
         return value1;
       } else if (condition2) {
         return value2;
       } else if (condition3) {
         return value3;
       } else {
         return value4;
       }
     }

175. ### What are the ways to execute javascript after page load

     You can execute javascript after page load in many different ways,

     1. **window.onload:**

     ```javascript
     window.onload = function ...
     ```

     1. **document.onload:**

     ```javascript
     document.onload = function ...
     ```

     1. **body onload:**

     ```javascript
     <body onload="script();">
     ```

176. ### What is the difference between proto and prototype

     The `__proto__` object is the actual object that is used in the lookup chain to resolve methods, etc. Whereas `prototype` is the object that is used to build `__proto__` when you create an object with new.

     ```javascript
     new Employee().__proto__ === Employee.prototype;
     new Employee().prototype === undefined;
     ```

     There are few more differences,

     | feature             | Prototype                            | proto                                      |

177. ### Give an example where do you really need semicolon

     It is recommended to use semicolons after every statement in JavaScript. For example, in the below case it throws an error ".. is not a function" at runtime due to missing semicolon.

     ```javascript
     // define a function
     var fn = (function () {
       //...
     })(
       // semicolon missing at this line

       // then execute some code inside a closure
       function () {
         //...
       }
     )();
     ```

     and it will be interpreted as

     ```javascript
     var fn = (function () {
       //...
     })(function () {
       //...
     })();
     ```

     In this case, we are passing the second function as an argument to the first function and then trying to call the result of the first function call as a function. Hence, the second function will fail with a "... is not a function" error at runtime.

178. ### What is a freeze method

     The **freeze()** method is used to freeze an object. Freezing an object does not allow adding new properties to an object,prevents from removing and prevents changing the enumerability, configurability, or writability of existing properties. i.e, It returns the passed object and does not create a frozen copy.

     ```javascript
     const obj = {
       prop: 100,
     };

     Object.freeze(obj);
     obj.prop = 200; // Throws an error in strict mode

     console.log(obj.prop); //100
     ```

     Remember freezing is only applied to the top-level properties in objects but not for nested objects. 
     For example, let's try to freeze user object which has employment details as nested object and observe that details have been changed.

     ```javascript
     const user = {
       name: 'John',
       employment: {
         department: 'IT'
       }
     };

     Object.freeze(user);
     user.employment.department = 'HR';
     ```


     **Note:** It causes a TypeError if the argument passed is not an object.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

179. ### What is the purpose of freeze method

     Below are the main benefits of using freeze method,

     1. It is used for freezing objects and arrays.
     2. It is used to make an object immutable.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

180. ### Why do I need to use freeze method

     In the Object-oriented paradigm, an existing API contains certain elements that are not intended to be extended, modified, or re-used outside of their current context. Hence it works as the `final` keyword which is used in various languages.

181. ### How do you detect a browser language preference

     You can use navigator object to detect a browser language preference as below,

     ```javascript
     var language =
       (navigator.languages && navigator.languages[0]) || // Chrome / Firefox
       navigator.language || // All browsers
       navigator.userLanguage; // IE <= 10

     console.log(language);
     ```

182. ### How to convert string to title case with javascript

     Title case means that the first letter of each word is capitalized. You can convert a string to title case using the below function,

     ```javascript
     function toTitleCase(str) {
       return str.replace(/\w\S*/g, function (txt) {
         return txt.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + txt.substring(1).toLowerCase();
       });
     }
     toTitleCase("good morning john"); // Good Morning John
     ```

183. ### How do you detect javascript disabled in the page

     You can use the `<noscript>` tag to detect javascript disabled or not. The code block inside `<noscript>` gets executed when JavaScript is disabled, and is typically used to display alternative content when the page generated in JavaScript.

     ```javascript
     <script type="javascript">
         // JS related code goes here
     </script>
     <noscript>
         <a href="next_page.html?noJS=true">JavaScript is disabled in the page. Please click Next Page</a>
     </noscript>

184. ### What are various operators supported by javascript

     An operator is capable of manipulating(mathematical and logical computations) a certain value or operand. There are various operators supported by JavaScript as below,

     1. **Arithmetic Operators:** Includes + (Addition),– (Subtraction), \* (Multiplication), / (Division), % (Modulus), + + (Increment) and – – (Decrement)
     2. **Comparison Operators:** Includes = =(Equal),!= (Not Equal), ===(Equal with type), > (Greater than),> = (Greater than or Equal to),< (Less than),<= (Less than or Equal to)
     3. **Logical Operators:** Includes &&(Logical AND),||(Logical OR),!(Logical NOT)
     4. **Assignment Operators:** Includes = (Assignment Operator), += (Add and Assignment Operator), – = (Subtract and Assignment Operator), \*= (Multiply and Assignment), /= (Divide and Assignment), %= (Modules and Assignment)
     5. **Ternary Operators:** It includes conditional(: ?) Operator
     6. **typeof Operator:** It uses to find type of variable. The syntax looks like `typeof variable`

185. ### What is a rest parameter

     Rest parameter is an improved way to handle function parameters which allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array. The syntax would be as below,

     ```javascript
     function f(a, b, ...theArgs) {
       // ...
     }
     ```

     For example, let's take a sum example to calculate on dynamic number of parameters,

     ```javascript
     function total(…args){
     let sum = 0;
     for(let i of args){
     sum+=i;
     }
     return sum;
     }
     console.log(fun(1,2)); //3
     console.log(fun(1,2,3)); //6
     console.log(fun(1,2,3,4)); //13
     console.log(fun(1,2,3,4,5)); //15
     ```

     **Note:** Rest parameter is added in ES2015 or ES6

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

186. ### What happens if you do not use rest parameter as a last argument

     The rest parameter should be the last argument, as its job is to collect all the remaining arguments into an array. For example, if you define a function like below it doesn’t make any sense and will throw an error.

     ```javascript
     function someFunc(a,…b,c){
     //You code goes here
     return;
     }
     ```

187. ### What are the bitwise operators available in javascript

     Below are the list of bitwise logical operators used in JavaScript

     1. Bitwise AND ( & )
     2. Bitwise OR ( | )
     3. Bitwise XOR ( ^ )
     4. Bitwise NOT ( ~ )
     5. Left Shift ( << )
     6. Sign Propagating Right Shift ( >> )
     7. Zero fill Right Shift ( >>> )

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

188. ### What is a spread operator

     Spread operator allows iterables( arrays / objects / strings ) to be expanded into single arguments/elements. Let's take an example to see this behavior,

     ```javascript
     function calculateSum(x, y, z) {
       return x + y + z;
     }

     const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

     console.log(calculateSum(...numbers)); // 6
     ```

189. ### How do you determine whether object is frozen or not

     Object.isFrozen() method is used to determine if an object is frozen or not.An object is frozen if all of the below conditions hold true,

     1. If it is not extensible.
     2. If all of its properties are non-configurable.
     3. If all its data properties are non-writable.
        The usage is going to be as follows,

     ```javascript
     const object = {
       property: "Welcome JS world",
     };
     Object.freeze(object);
     console.log(Object.isFrozen(object));
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

190. ### How do you determine two values same or not using object

     The Object.is() method determines whether two values are the same value. For example, the usage with different types of values would be,

     ```javascript
     Object.is("hello", "hello"); // true
     Object.is(window, window); // true
     Object.is([], []); // false
     ```

     Two values are the same if one of the following holds:

     1. both undefined
     2. both null
     3. both true or both false
     4. both strings of the same length with the same characters in the same order
     5. both the same object (means both object have same reference)
     6. both numbers and
        both +0
        both -0
        both NaN
        both non-zero and both not NaN and both have the same value.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

191. ### What is the purpose of using object is method

     Some of the applications of Object's `is` method are follows,

     1. It is used for comparison of two strings.
     2. It is used for comparison of two numbers.
     3. It is used for comparing the polarity of two numbers.
     4. It is used for comparison of two objects.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

192. ### How do you copy properties from one object to other

     You can use the Object.assign() method which is used to copy the values and properties from one or more source objects to a target object. It returns the target object which has properties and values copied from the source objects. The syntax would be as below,

     ```javascript
     Object.assign(target, ...sources);
     ```

     Let's take example with one source and one target object,

     ```javascript
     const target = { a: 1, b: 2 };
     const source = { b: 3, c: 4 };

     const returnedTarget = Object.assign(target, source);

     console.log(target); // { a: 1, b: 3, c: 4 }

     console.log(returnedTarget); // { a: 1, b: 3, c: 4 }
     ```

     As observed in the above code, there is a common property(`b`) from source to target so it's value has been overwritten.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

193. ### What are the applications of assign method

     Below are the some of main applications of Object.assign() method,

     1. It is used for cloning an object.
     2. It is used to merge objects with the same properties.

194. ### What is a proxy object

     The Proxy object is used to define custom behavior for fundamental operations such as property lookup, assignment, enumeration, function invocation, etc. The syntax would be as follows,

     ```javascript
     var p = new Proxy(target, handler);
     ```

     Let's take an example of proxy object,

     ```javascript
     var handler = {
       get: function (obj, prop) {
         return prop in obj ? obj[prop] : 100;
       },
     };

     var p = new Proxy({}, handler);
     p.a = 10;
     p.b = null;

     console.log(p.a, p.b); // 10, null
     console.log("c" in p, p.c); // false, 100
     ```

     In the above code, it uses `get` handler which define the behavior of the proxy when an operation is performed on it

195. ### What is the purpose of seal method

     The **Object.seal()** method is used to seal an object, by preventing new properties from being added to it and marking all existing properties as non-configurable. But values of present properties can still be changed as long as they are writable. Let's see the below example to understand more about seal() method

     ```javascript
     const object = {
       property: "Welcome JS world",
     };
     Object.seal(object);
     object.property = "Welcome to object world";
     console.log(Object.isSealed(object)); // true
     delete object.property; // You cannot delete when sealed
     console.log(object.property); //Welcome to object world
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

196. ### What are the applications of seal method

     Below are the main applications of Object.seal() method,

     1. It is used for sealing objects and arrays.
     2. It is used to make an object immutable.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

197. ### What are the differences between freeze and seal methods

     If an object is frozen using the Object.freeze() method then its properties become immutable and no changes can be made in them whereas if an object is sealed using the Object.seal() method then the changes can be made in the existing properties of the object.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

198. ### How do you determine if an object is sealed or not

     The Object.isSealed() method is used to determine if an object is sealed or not. An object is sealed if all of the below conditions hold true

     1. If it is not extensible.
     2. If all of its properties are non-configurable.
     3. If it is not removable (but not necessarily non-writable).
        Let's see it in the action

     ```javascript
     const object = {
       property: "Hello, Good morning",
     };

     Object.seal(object); // Using seal() method to seal the object

     console.log(Object.isSealed(object)); // checking whether the object is sealed or not
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

199. ### How do you get enumerable key and value pairs

     The Object.entries() method is used to return an array of a given object's own enumerable string-keyed property [key, value] pairs, in the same order as that provided by a for...in loop. Let's see the functionality of object.entries() method in an example,

     ```javascript
     const object = {
       a: "Good morning",
       b: 100,
     };

     for (let [key, value] of Object.entries(object)) {
       console.log(`${key}: ${value}`); // a: 'Good morning'
       // b: 100
     }
     ```

     **Note:** The order is not guaranteed as object defined.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

200. ### What is the main difference between Object.values and Object.entries method

     The Object.values() method's behavior is similar to Object.entries() method but it returns an array of values instead [key,value] pairs.

     ```javascript
     const object = {
       a: "Good morning",
       b: 100,
     };

     for (let value of Object.values(object)) {
       console.log(`${value}`); // 'Good morning'
       100;
     }
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

201. ### How can you get the list of keys of any object

     You can use the `Object.keys()` method which is used to return an array of a given object's own property names, in the same order as we get with a normal loop. For example, you can get the keys of a user object,

     ```javascript
     const user = {
       name: "John",
       gender: "male",
       age: 40,
     };

     console.log(Object.keys(user)); //['name', 'gender', 'age']
     ```

202. ### How do you create an object with prototype

     The Object.create() method is used to create a new object with the specified prototype object and properties. i.e, It uses an existing object as the prototype of the newly created object. It returns a new object with the specified prototype object and properties.

     ```javascript
     const user = {
       name: "John",
       printInfo: function () {
         console.log(`My name is ${this.name}.`);
       },
     };

     const admin = Object.create(user);

     admin.name = "Nick"; // Remember that "name" is a property set on "admin" but not on "user" object

     admin.printInfo(); // My name is Nick
     ```

209. ### What is the purpose of uneval

     The uneval() is an inbuilt function which is used to create a string representation of the source code of an Object. It is a top-level function and is not associated with any object. Let's see the below example to know more about it's functionality,

     ```javascript
     var a = 1;
     uneval(a); // returns a String containing 1
     uneval(function user() {}); // returns "(function user(){})"
     ```

211. ### How do you decode an URL

     The decodeURI() function is used to decode a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) previously created by encodeURI().

     ```javascript
     var uri = "https://mozilla.org/?x=шеллы";
     var encoded = encodeURI(uri);
     console.log(encoded); // https://mozilla.org/?x=%D1%88%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%BB%D1%8B
     try {
       console.log(decodeURI(encoded)); // "https://mozilla.org/?x=шеллы"
     } catch (e) {
       // catches a malformed URI
       console.error(e);
     }
     ```

212. ### How do you print the contents of web page

     The window object provided a print() method which is used to print the contents of the current window. It opens a Print dialog box which lets you choose between various printing options. Let's see the usage of print method in an example,

     ```html
     <input type="button" value="Print" onclick="window.print()" />
     ```

     **Note:** In most browsers, it will block while the print dialog is open.

213. ### What is the difference between uneval and eval

     The `uneval` function returns the source of a given object; whereas the `eval` function does the opposite, by evaluating that source code in a different memory area. Let's see an example to clarify the difference,

     ```javascript
     var msg = uneval(function greeting() {
       return "Hello, Good morning";
     });
     var greeting = eval(msg);
     greeting(); // returns "Hello, Good morning"
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

214. ### What is an anonymous function

     An anonymous function is a function without a name! Anonymous functions are commonly assigned to a variable name or used as a callback function. The syntax would be as below,

     ```javascript
     function (optionalParameters) {
       //do something
     }

     const myFunction = function(){ //Anonymous function assigned to a variable
       //do something
     };

     [1, 2, 3].map(function(element){ //Anonymous function used as a callback function
       //do something
     });
     ```

     Let's see the above anonymous function in an example,

     ```javascript
     var x = function (a, b) {
       return a * b;
     };
     var z = x(5, 10);
     console.log(z); // 50
     ```

215. ### What is the precedence order between local and global variables

     A local variable takes precedence over a global variable with the same name. Let's see this behavior in an example.

     ```javascript
     var msg = "Good morning";
     function greeting() {
       msg = "Good Evening";
       console.log(msg); // Good Evening
     }
     greeting();
     ```

216. ### What are javascript accessors

     ECMAScript 5 introduced javascript object accessors or computed properties through getters and setters. Getters uses the `get` keyword whereas Setters uses the `set` keyword.

     ```javascript
     var user = {
       firstName: "John",
       lastName : "Abraham",
       language : "en",
       get lang() {
         return this.language;
       },
       set lang(lang) {
       this.language = lang;
       }
     };
     console.log(user.lang); // getter access lang as en
     user.lang = 'fr';
     console.log(user.lang); // setter used to set lang as fr
     ```

217. ### How do you define property on Object constructor

     The Object.defineProperty() static method is used to define a new property directly on an object, or modify an existing property on an object, and returns the object. Let's see an example to know how to define property,

     ```javascript
     const newObject = {};

     Object.defineProperty(newObject, "newProperty", {
       value: 100,
       writable: false,
     });

     console.log(newObject.newProperty); // 100

     newObject.newProperty = 200; // It throws an error in strict mode due to writable setting
     ```

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

218. ### What is the difference between get and defineProperty

     Both have similar results until unless you use classes. If you use `get` the property will be defined on the prototype of the object whereas using `Object.defineProperty()` the property will be defined on the instance it is applied to.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

219. ### What are the advantages of Getters and Setters

     Below are the list of benefits of Getters and Setters,

     1. They provide simpler syntax
     2. They are used for defining computed properties, or accessors in JS.
     3. Useful to provide equivalence relation between properties and methods
     4. They can provide better data quality
     5. Useful for doing things behind the scenes with the encapsulated logic.

     **[⬆ Back to Top](#table-of-contents)**

220. ### Can I add getters and setters using defineProperty method

     Yes, You can use the `Object.defineProperty()` method to add Getters and Setters. For example, the below counter object uses increment, decrement, add and subtract properties,

     ```javascript
     var obj = { counter: 0 };

     // Define getters
     Object.defineProperty(obj, "increment", {
       get: function () {
         this.counter++;
       },
     });
     Object.defineProperty(obj, "decrement", {
       get: function () {
         this.counter--;
       },
     });

     // Define setters
     Object.defineProperty(obj, "add", {
       set: function (value) {
         this.counter += value;
       },
     });
     Object.defineProperty(obj, "subtract", {
       set: function (value) {
         this.counter -= value;
       },
     });

     obj.add = 10;
     obj.subtract = 5;
     console.log(obj.increment); //6
     console.log(obj.decrement); //5
     ```

     The switch case statement in JavaScript is used for decision making purposes. In a few cases, using the switch case statement is going to be more convenient than if-else statements. The syntax would be as below,

     ```javascript
     switch (expression)
     {
         case value1:
             statement1;
             break;
         case value2:
             statement2;
             break;
         .
         .
         case valueN:
             statementN;
             break;
         default:
             statementDefault;
     }
     ```

     The above multi-way branch statement provides an easy way to dispatch execution to different parts of code based on the value of the expression.

222. ### What are the conventions to be followed for the usage of switch case

     Below are the list of conventions should be taken care,

     1. The expression can be of type either number or string.
     2. Duplicate values are not allowed for the expression.
     3. The default statement is optional. If the expression passed to switch does not match with any case value then the statement within default case will be executed.
     4. The break statement is used inside the switch to terminate a statement sequence.
     5. The break statement is optional. But if it is omitted, the execution will continue on into the next case.

223. ### What are primitive data types

     A primitive data type is data that has a primitive value (which has no properties or methods). There are 7 types of primitive data types.

     1. string
     2. number
     3. boolean
     4. null
     5. undefined
     6. bigint
     7. symbol

224. ### What are the different ways to access object properties

     There are 3 possible ways for accessing the property of an object.

     1. **Dot notation:** It uses dot for accessing the properties

     ```javascript
     objectName.property;
     ```

     1. **Square brackets notation:** It uses square brackets for property access

     ```javascript
     objectName["property"];
     ```

     1. **Expression notation:** It uses expression in the square brackets

     ```javascript
     objectName[expression];
     ```

225. ### What are the function parameter rules

     JavaScript functions follow below rules for parameters,

     1. The function definitions do not specify data types for parameters.
     2. Do not perform type checking on the passed arguments.
     3. Do not check the number of arguments received.
        i.e, The below function follows the above rules,

     ```javascript
     function functionName(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
       console.log(parameter1); // 1
     }
     functionName(1);
     ```

226. ### What is an error object

     An error object is a built in error object that provides error information when an error occurs. It has two properties: name and message. For example, the below function logs error details,

     ```javascript
     try {
       greeting("Welcome");
     } catch (err) {
       console.log(err.name + "<br>" + err.message);
     }
     ```

227. ### When you get a syntax error

     A SyntaxError is thrown if you try to evaluate code with a syntax error. For example, the below missing quote for the function parameter throws a syntax error

     ```javascript
     try {
       eval("greeting('welcome)"); // Missing ' will produce an error
     } catch (err) {
       console.log(err.name);
     }
     ```

228. ### What are the different error names from error object

     There are 6 different types of error names returned from error object,
     | Error Name | Description |
     |---- | ---------
     | EvalError | An error has occurred in the eval() function |
     | RangeError | An error has occurred with a number "out of range" |
     | ReferenceError | An error due to an illegal reference|
     | SyntaxError | An error due to a syntax error|
     | TypeError | An error due to a type error |
     | URIError | An error due to encodeURI() |

229. ### What are the various statements in error handling

     Below are the list of statements used in an error handling,

     1. **try:** This statement is used to test a block of code for errors
     2. **catch:** This statement is used to handle the error
     3. **throw:** This statement is used to create custom errors.
     4. **finally:** This statement is used to execute code after try and catch regardless of the result.

230. ### What are the two types of loops in javascript

     1. **Entry Controlled loops:** In this kind of loop type, the test condition is tested before entering the loop body. For example, For Loop and While Loop comes under this category.
     2. **Exit Controlled Loops:** In this kind of loop type, the test condition is tested or evaluated at the end of the loop body. i.e, the loop body will execute at least once irrespective of test condition true or false. For example, do-while loop comes under this category.
